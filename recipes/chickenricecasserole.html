        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I grew up with this chicken and rice casserole recipe.
            My Grandmother got it from a lady from church at a pot luck a long
            time ago! She passed it down to my mom and it's always been a family 
            favorite. Quick and easy for school nights, and the leftovers ar
            e just as good! You can use less butter on top of course, my Momma
            and Mamaw always put the full stick on top (gotta love Southern ladies 
            and their butter!)
        </p>
